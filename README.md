The pixel analysis is not all inclusive. I have not been able to do any real world testing. 

If you use this project, then you should create a list of specific colors by using the Windows Color Picker (Win + Shift + c)

Then trial and error analyzing the result and adding in new colors should result in a conclusive Database of Colors that do not represent Vegetation.
